Compares rolling methods for D&amp;D, Pathfinder etc..
In part just to  practice nesting functions in Ruby, I thought about answering the age old question amongst gamers on which die rolling method was better.
The two most common types amongst my group of riends were the 3d6 eight times, removing the two lowest rolls, or 4d6 take away lowest die.
Each method was built seperately and then added together in one application. Then replacing a fixed number of rolls with a variable, given by the user while running the application.
